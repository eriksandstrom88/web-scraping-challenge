# web-scraping-challenge

This repository contains Homework 12, web-scraping-challenge for the University of Denver's Data Analytics Bootcamp.  

I began this activity writing python code in Jupyter Notebook to scrape data off of four different website.  Once the scraping code was functioning properly, I migrated the code over to the scrape_mars.py file in VS Code.  I connected this code to another file, app.py, which is a Flask app to execute the scraping code and ultimately render it to a website.  The website is not live--it can be viewed on a local machine by executing the app.py file.  The HTML file in the Templates folder populates a web page with the scraped data, including a button to re-scrape for the most current data.

Thanks for reading!
